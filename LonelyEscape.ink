= swirling_drain
The water rushes around you, pulling you down into the darkness, where you're suddenly plunged into the sea. It's cold but it's freedom.
* [Turn back]
    The aquarium looms over the pier. It's so much bigger than you ever thought possible.
    Your mind wanders to the people you left behind.
    You turn and leave
    -> END
* [Keep swimming]
    You swim deeper into the ocean.
    -> END
